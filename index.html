            <li style="color: coral;">I am now going to do a report on every single character from luffys crew starting with zoro </li>
            <li style="color: coral;">Roronoa Zoro, also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro, is a main combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates, one of their two swordsmen, one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet,[4] and is publicly recognized as the right-hand man of his crew's captain Monkey D. Luffy.[21][22] Formerly a bounty hunter,[6] he is the second member of Luffy's crew and the first to join it, doing so in the Romance Dawn Arc.[2]

                Born in the East Blue,<br> Zoro is the son of Tera and Roronoa Arashi, the grandson of Shimotsuki Furiko and Roronoa Pinzoro, and the grandnephew of Shimotsuki Ushimaru, making him a descendant of both the Shimotsuki Family of Wano Country and the legendary samurai, Shimotsuki Ryuma.[3][11] As a master of Three Sword Style, a swordsmanship style which he created during his childhood training in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is one of the three most powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Sanji, who are referred to as the "Monster Trio".[23][24] His dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the world, in order to honor a promise he made to his deceased childhood friend and distant cousin Kuina.[25]
                
                <br>In addition to his infamy as one of the Straw Hats and as a former bounty hunter, his sizeable bounty upon arriving at the Sabaody Archipelago caused Zoro, along with Luffy to be included among the eleven "Super Rookies", pirates who simultaneously reached the Red Line with bounties of over Beli100,000,000 shortly before the Summit War.[26] He, the other ten Super Rookies, and Marshall D. Teach would go on to be referred to as the "Worst Generation."[27]
                
                Zoro gained his first bounty of Beli60,000,000 after the Alabasta Arc. It later increased to Beli 120,000,000 after the Enies Lobby incident, then again to Beli 320,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to Beli1,111,000,000.</li>

                     <li style="color: coral;">Next up Usopp.God" Usopp is the sniper of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.[2] He is the fourth member of the crew and the third to join.<br> Doing so at the end of the Syrup Village Arc. Although he left the crew during the Water 7 Arc, he rejoined at the end of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc.[16]

                       <br> Usopp is the son of Yasopp and the late Banchina. He was born and raised in Syrup Village, serving as "captain" of the Usopp Pirates and being Kaya's close friend. After working with the Straw Hats to defeat Kuro and the Black Cat Pirates, he was invited to join the crew. Despite his usual cowardice, Usopp dreams of becoming a brave warrior of the sea just like his father and lives every day in pursuit of living up to this dream.
                        
                        He first gained a bounty of Beli30,000,000 under his Sogeking Persona after the incident at Enies Lobby. After the Dressrosa Arc, Usopp gained a bounty of Beli200,000,000 under his own name. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to Beli500,000,000.[2]<br></li>

                                She was formerly a member of the Arlong Pirates and initially joined the Straw Hats so that she could rob them in order to buy back her village from Arlong. However, she legitimately joined the Straw Hats after they rebelled against and defeated Arlong. Her dream is to make a map of the entire world.[20]
                                
                                She first gained a bounty of Beli16,000,000 following the raid on Enies Lobby. It later increased to Beli66,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc. Following the Raid on Onigashima, her bounty was increased to Beli366,000,000.[4]</li>

                                <li style="color: coral;">Thats about all for Nami,we will now move on to Sanji."Black Leg" Sanji,[12] born as Vinsmoke Sanji,[21][22][23] is the cook of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.[5] He is the fifth member of the crew and the fourth to join, doing so at the end of the Baratie Arc.

                                    Born as the third son and fourth child of the Vinsmoke Family[24] (thus, making him a former prince of the Germa Kingdom), he disowned his family twice, once in his youth and again after reuniting with them as an adult.[25] After fleeing the Vinsmokes as a child, he eventually entered the care of Zeff as the sous chef of the Baratie, where he would remain until he met Monkey D. Luffy, who convinced him to join his crew.
                                    
                                    His dream is to find the rumored chef's paradise, All Blue, which is where the East Blue, West Blue, North Blue, and South Blue meet, along with their wildlife. He is one of the top three fighters of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Zoro, who are referred to as the "Monster Trio".[26][27]
                                    
                                    He first gained a bounty of Beli77,000,000 for his role in the raid on Enies Lobby. It increased to Beli177,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc, but the condition of his bounty was changed to Only Alive due to his biological father's interference. After he escaped from Big Mom's territory, his bounty condition was reverted back to Dead or Alive, and its value increased to Beli330,000,000.[19] Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to Beli1,032,000,000.[5] Despite renouncing his surname Vinsmoke,[22] the World Government labels it as part of his name on his wanted poster

He was temporarily forced to join the Foxy Pirates during the Long Ring Long Land Arc, but was quickly returned to Luffy's crew.

                                Chopper is a reindeer that ate the Hito Hito no Mi, a Devil Fruit that allows its user to transform into a human hybrid at will. He was taught medicine on Drum Island by his two parental figures, Doctors Hiriluk and Kureha. Chopper aims to travel all across the world in the hopes of accomplishing his dream of being able to cure any disease.
                                
                                Chopper gained his first bounty of Beli50 after the incident at Enies Lobby, having been mistaken for the Straw Hats' pet. After the Dressrosa Arc, it was increased to Beli100, then to Beli1,000 following the Raid on Onigashima.[</li>

                                    Born into a family of archaeologists, Robin is the daughter of Nico Olvia and an unknown man. Robin ate the Hana Hana no Mi at a young age, giving her the power to reproduce her body parts (or her entire body) on any surface at will. As the sole survivor of the destroyed West Blue island Ohara, she is currently one of only two people in the world known to have the ability to read and decipher Poneglyphs, a skill which is considered forbidden and threatening to the World Government.
                                    
                                    She acted as the vice president of Baroque Works as "Miss All Sunday",[1] serving and partnering herself directly with the organization's president; the ex-Warlord: Crocodile, who operated under the codename "Mr. 0". She was a secondary antagonist of the Arabasta Saga, before joining the Straw Hats. Her dream is to find the Rio Poneglyph which tells the true history of the world, specifically the Void Century.
                                    
                                    She gained a bounty of Beli79,000,000 at the age of 8 due to her ability to read poneglyphs after the destruction of Ohara. It later increased to Beli80,000,000 after the Straw Hats invaded Enies Lobby to rescue her and escape. After the Dressrosa Arc, it was increased to Beli130,000,000.

                                 Iron Man" Franky[7] is the shipwright of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.[2] He is the crew's eighth member and the seventh to join, doing so at the end of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc.[17]

                                 Born "Cutty Flam",[18] he chose to go by his nickname of "Franky" until eventually permanently discarding his true name per the request of Iceburg to hide his identity.[19] Originally from the South Blue,[20] Franky was abandoned by his family as a four-year-old, eventually making his way to Water 7. There, he came to be a member of Tom's Workers, until an incident resulted in his body being heavily damaged and requiring him to augment himself into a cyborg. Upon returning to Water 7, he became the leader of the Franky Family, a group of ship dismantlers and bounty hunters.[3]
                                 
                                 Franky and his followers were originally enemies of the Straw Hats at the beginning of the Water 7 Arc, until circumstances forced them to become allies at the end of the same arc and the Enies Lobby Arc. Franky's dream is to create a ship and circumnavigate the world with it, and he built the Thousand Sunny and joined the Straw Hat Pirates to fulfill his dream.
                                 
                                 He gained a bounty of Beli44,000,000 for his involvement at the Enies Lobby Incident. It later increased to Beli94,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to Beli394,000,000.[2]</li>

                                        <li style="color:coral">Now let us move on to finally jimbei."Knight of the Sea" Jinbe[1] is the helmsman of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.[3] He is the tenth member of the crew and the ninth to join, doing so during the Wano Country Arc.[16]

                                            Jinbe is a whale shark fish-man and a powerful master of Fish-Man Karate. His dream is to fulfill his former captain Fisher Tiger's dying wish of coexistence and equality between humans and fish-men. He was a member of the Sun Pirates, eventually becoming its second captain after the death of their original captain, Tiger.[9] He eventually became one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, though he resigned during the Summit War of Marineford.[5][9] Vegapunk later cloned Jinbe as one of the Seraphim, S-Shark, to replace the Warlords.[17]
                                            
                                            Prior to and amidst said war, Jinbe befriended Monkey D. Luffy, and two years later allied with him and his crew to prevent the New Fish-Man Pirates' coup d'état against the Ryugu Kingdom's Neptune Royal Family. Luffy thereafter invited him to join the Straw Hat Pirates, but Jinbe held it off until severing ties with Big Mom during the Whole Cake Island Arc.[2] After staying behind in Totto Land to protect the Sun Pirates from Big Mom's wrath, Jinbe returned to the Straw Hats during the Wano Country Arc, officially announcing his status as a member of the crew.[16]
                                            
                                            He first gained a bounty of Beli76,000,000 due to him being a member of the Sun Pirates. It was later increased to Beli250,000,000 after Jinbe became the new captain of the Sun Pirates before it was frozen after he joined the Seven Warlords. Upon resigning his position as a Warlord at the Summit War of Marineford, his bounty was reinstated at Beli438,000,000.[13] Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to Beli1,100,000,000.[3]</li>
